Hyperspectral Imagery Classification

Here, I show some basic and state-of-the-art methods for hyperspectral imagery classification.

For detail, please read every readme file in the specificed methods.
In this readme, I will give a brief description for every methods.

-------------------------------
## Traditional machine learning based methods
- Logical Regression
- KNN
- SVM

-------------------------------
## Deep learning based methods
- 1D-CNN
